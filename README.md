# rnm
Raspberry Network Manager

Purpose: Provide services that can connect a headless raspberry to a wifi network. Let's say we have a device equipped with a rpi and that we place it in a new wifi environment. Then we would like to have an easy way (for non-technical end-users) to enable wireless networking for our device. If the device does not find a guest network, then it should start an access point and provide some service for further wifi network configuration.
